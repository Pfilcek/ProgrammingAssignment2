## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    
    # using `<<-` to assign value in a different environment 

    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setSolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
  getSolve <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setSolve = setSolve,
       getSolve = getSolve)  
  
  
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getSolve()
  
  
  # if the inverse has already been calculated
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  
  # otherwise, calculates the inverse 
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  
  
  x$setSolve(m)
  return(m)
}
